# DETR-Fine-tuning-on-Fashionpedia-Dataset-v3.0
Text Summarizer Using Transformer
📌 Overview

This project implements a text summarization model powered by Transformer architectures. It takes long-form text and generates concise summaries, making it useful for applications like news aggregation, research paper summarization, and content curation.

The implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook (text-summarizer-using-transformer.ipynb) for easy experimentation and customization.

🚀 Features

Uses state-of-the-art Transformer models for text summarization.

Preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and tokenizing text.

Training and inference in a single notebook.

Customizable for different datasets.

Supports both extractive and abstractive summarization (depending on model configuration).

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on your setup)

Hugging Face Transformers

NLTK / SpaCy for text preprocessing

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation
